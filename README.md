# SetupMac
set a new mac with my own habit setting.
## Before this repo

Original fork [automatic/dotfiles](https://github.com/atomantic/dotfiles), thx a lot~

And I find my fitness method to build init of mac. so I delete repo before I fork.

Now this repo is setup for a new Mac, It won't set up dotfiles for mac.

About dotfiles, I use [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to backup and restore, plus use this to symlink for big files, so I can take over all I need when I change Mac Or backup my own file.

## setup

### 1. install

when download this repo done, put it to $HOME directory, and run `install.sh`; it will setup MacOS some preference, make sure you are clear what the shell file do before run the command. **the file must have something you don't want to have.**

## mackup restore

then restore the dotfiles and other big/personal file symlink use mackup. (make sure it is installed).
